# Final Project Proposal
### George Mi, 
 
## **Description:**
#### A brick breaker style of game that has a platform the player controls that causes a ball to bounce and hit the bricks

## **Need to have list:**
- Collision detection
- Bounds detection
- Ball has an initial trajectory the player chooses before starting the game
- Ball's trajectory is sometimes random so as not to be stuck in place forever

## **Nice to have list:**
- Sounds when the ball hits an object
- Powerups like multiple balls or a larger platform
- Score Counter
- Lives
- Different coloured bricks for different amounts of hits needed to break

## **Similar programs:**
- Arkanoid
- Brick Breaker
- AAtari breakout

## **Target User:**
Someone that enjoys old games
